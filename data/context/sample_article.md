Title: Phase 2 Trial Snapshot for Once-Daily Compound ZN-314

The randomized, double-blind trial enrolled 180 adults with moderate inflammatory disease activity.
Participants were assigned in a 2:1 ratio to ZN-314 50 mg once daily or placebo for 12 weeks.
The primary endpoint was change in composite symptom score from baseline to week 12.

At week 12, mean symptom score improved by 7.8 points in the ZN-314 group and 3.1 points in placebo.
The between-group difference was -4.7 points (95% CI, -6.2 to -3.1; p < 0.001).
A prespecified subgroup with baseline CRP above 10 mg/L showed a larger mean improvement of 9.1 points on ZN-314.

Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 38% of ZN-314 participants and 33% of placebo participants.
The most common events in ZN-314 were mild nausea (11%) and transient headache (9%).
No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported.

A pharmacokinetic substudy found median Tmax of 2.5 hours and apparent terminal half-life of 18 hours.
Steady state was reached by day 5 with an accumulation ratio of 1.4.
Food delayed Tmax by roughly 1 hour but did not materially change AUC.
